# ClassProjects
Projects completed by myself for SNHU classes.


The project I was tasked with doing was to create a program that took inventory generated throughout the day and analyzed how many items were purchased. The item data is presented in a text format and my specific task was to organize that data by allowing a user to see how many times total that item was purchased. They could do this with a search for the item specifically, by printing all items with numerical representations of the items next to the names, or by printing a histogram of all items and asterisks representing the number of purchases made throughout the day.    

What I feel I did particularly well when developing this code was user input validation as well as error handling. I made it so there was very little room for error when utilizing the menu system in the main function and if something did go wrong you would know where it went wrong by the error code thrown.  

There are some areas I feel my code would do well with improvements. For insane, the menu system could be implemented in a class instead of printed form the main function. That way future improvements or implementations of the menu system can be easier if it is needed in other areas of the code and also clean the main function up for easier readability. Also, another improvement, which is more cosmetic than functional, is I could make would be to format the print functions for the menu options to make the printouts more appealing to look at such as table boarders or text colors. Also, a function to write or read different files from different locations would also be helpful and I am sure at some point necessary, so separating that into a new class would be beneficial to the program as well.   

The most difficult aspect of this project for me was file manipulation. When I first started creatin the file functions in the ItemTracker class I could not read the items from Inventory.txt as it kept throwing an error when I tried to compile the code. I ended up spending the better part of an hour trying different approaches to get the file to read but nothing I did worked. I searched google for what angle I could take to find out what was wrong, and I ended up pooling my resources by asking some people with more experience with file manipulation and they gave me some tips on how to debug the process. I found through debugging with error handling that the file was not being found due to how I imported it into the file directory.  I fixed this issue by creating a function that wrote the text file path directly where I needed it to be read for the main program.  

I learned a lot from this project, and a skill I feel will transfer well to other projects is the ability to handle errors by breaking them down into smaller pieces and finding out the root of the error instead of running code, fixing random spots, and running code again. The process of debugging that I found out from my resources will be important for how I tackle issues in the future.  

Overall, I made this program maintainable by developing a class that handled the required functionality of the application. I made it readable by adding inline comments on the important parts of the code itself as well as using conventional namespaces for variables and obvious names for functions that tell you exactly what they do. The program itself is also adaptable as the class system allows me to derive other classes from it, include its contents in other functions, or improve on the functions that work alongside it such as the menu class improvements I mentioned earlier
