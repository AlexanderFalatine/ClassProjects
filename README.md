# ClassProjects
Projects completed by myself for SNHU classes.


The project I was tasked with doing was to create a program that took inventory generated through the day, and analyzes how many items were purchased. The item data is presented in a text format and my specific task was to organize that data by allowing a user to see how many times total that item was purchased. They could do this with a search for the item specifically, by printing all items with numerical representations of the items next to the names, or by printing a histogram of all items and asterisks representing the number of purchases made throughout the day.
